/// Identifier for the evidence type for protein existence.
///
/// An identifier used by biological databases for the level of evidence
/// that supports a protein's existence. Strong evidence includes
/// evidence at the protein level, while weaker evidence is evidence
/// at the transcript (or mRNA) level. Weak evidence is inferred from
/// homology from similar species. Curated protein databases frequently
/// only include proteins identified at the protein level.
///
/// `Unknown` is a custom value for invalid entries, or those with yet-
/// to-be annotated protein evidence scores.
